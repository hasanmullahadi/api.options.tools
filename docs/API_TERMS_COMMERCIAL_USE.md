## 🚨 WHAT NOT TO DO

1. **DON'T** use free APIs and resell the data
2. **DON'T** scrape websites without permission
3. **DON'T** claim data is yours when it's not
4. **DON'T** violate API terms of service

## ✅ WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. **DO** use SEC EDGAR data (100% free & legal)
2. **DO** charge for your analysis/algorithms
3. **DO** use mock data with clear disclaimers
4. **DO** apply for partner programs
5. **DO** be transparent about data sources

## 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Start with this model:
```
Your Pricing Tiers:
- Developer: $49/month (mock data + SEC filings)
- Professional: $249/month (includes $50 data costs)
- Enterprise: $999/month (includes $200 data costs)
```

### Your Value Proposition:
- NOT selling raw data (that's commodity)

- Data is just an input cost (like AWS hosting)
